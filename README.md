# ![Fz](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7301270?s=25) Fuzzy Autocomplete for Xcode

## Xcode 7 support

Most things seem to work. To try out the plugin in Xcode 7, clone the `xcode7` branch and build the plugin. And please do file any encountered issues on github.

Install via Alcatraz and/or binary release coming soon.

## `FuzzyAutocomplete 2.1` 
 
This is a Xcode 5+ plugin that patches the autocomplete filter to work the same way the **Open Quickly** works. It performs very well, and the fuzzy matching actually uses Xcode's own `IDEOpenQuicklyPattern`.
